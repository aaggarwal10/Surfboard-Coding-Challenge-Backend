# Surfboard-Coding-Challenge-Backend
This is the small backend, I created for the Zoom API. It allows the frontend to use a simple REST API to create a Zoom Meeting by returning the Zoom Link.
For more information on the product created please read the ReadMe in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/aaggarwal10/Surfboard-Coding-Challenge).
